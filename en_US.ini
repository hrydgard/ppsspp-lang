#Notes to translators:
#1. Ampersands(&) on the RIGHT side of equals signs denotes an underlined keyboard hotkey.
#If you need to use a real ampersand on the RIGHT, use two(&&).
#Example 1: &File. This will make it so when you press ALT + F on Windows, it'll open the File menu.
#Example 2: Homebrew && demos. This will make it so one real regular ampersand shows up in the 
#graphical UI.
#Current issues: "Cheats" is used in multiple categories in multiple places. We need to trim it to one.
